# Building a RESTful API with Node.js and Express

## Introduction

Building a RESTful API is a fundamental skill for web developers. In this guide, we'll explore how to create a RESTful API using Node.js and the Express framework.

## Background

### Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side, enabling the development of scalable network applications.

Install Node.js using:

```bash
npm install node
```

### Express

[Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building robust web applications and APIs.

Install Express using:

```bash
npm install express
```

## Implementation

### Create Express Application

Start by creating an Express application. Define routes for different API endpoints, such as `/users` or `/products`.

### Middleware for Authentication

Implement middleware for authentication to secure your API. You can use packages like Passport.js for handling authentication strategies.

### Connect to a Database

Connect your API to a database to store and retrieve data. MongoDB is a popular choice for NoSQL databases in Node.js applications.

## Conclusion

Building a RESTful API with Node.js and Express provides a scalable and efficient solution for handling HTTP requests. This guide covers the basics, but there's always room to expand and enhance your API based on specific project requirements.
